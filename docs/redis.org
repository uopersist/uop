So what would happen if we used Redis for cache or even in memory database?

* simple key value
** 'UOP' or user-id main key
** ids are universal thus the main key can be an id
** collection types (of ids normally) can largely be sets
*** beauty is that Redis sets can be intersected, unioned, etc in Redis.
** classes - set of class ids
** groups - set of group ids
** etc..
** what of user sharding
*** courd have userid as prefix
**** a bit hard to get all of users stuff out of cache/memory
Can keep set of in cache/memory user specific ids
